# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview

This project is a simple machine learning classification project that uses the famous Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species based on their features. The project is implemented in Python and uses popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and NumPy.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `iris_classification.py`: The main Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries for the project.
- `data/`: Directory containing the Iris dataset (CSV format).
- `models/`: Directory to store trained machine learning models.
- `README.md`: The project's README file (you're reading it).

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your system. You can set up the required Python environment by running the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification


2. Run the main script:

bash
python iris_classification.py


The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train a machine learning model, and provide predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These samples belong to three different species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica.

- Dataset Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

## Models

We use a simple machine learning model (e.g., Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine) for classification. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

## Evaluation

You can evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This information will be displayed when running the `iris_classification.py` script.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any improvements or bug fixes to suggest, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
